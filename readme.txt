rootsPersona creates one or more pages of family history using data imported from a Gedcom file (version 5.5).

== Description ==
**REFACTORED TO REMOVE DEPENDENCE ON PHP 5.3**

rootsPersona creates one or more pages of family history using data imported from one or more Gedcom files.

**Features**
- Support for Gedcom Version 5.5
- Ability to upload more than one Gedcom file from the same source and link families together
- Ability to select which persons from the Gedcom file to create pages for
- As updates are made, Gedcom files can be reloaded and existing pages will be updated
- Each page includes links to children and spouses
- Each page displays a visual family tree that includes three generations
- Ability to link pictures uploaded to Wordpress to each person (up to 7)
- Pages identifed as 'Permission Required' will only be displayed to users who are logged into your Wordpress site

*Note: importing Gedcom files from different programs can have unexpected consequences.
rootsPersona uses the ids generated in the gedcom file, and different programs may assign the same ids to different people.
It is recommended to manage your data in a single program (the 'system of record'),
and to use Gedcom files generated by that program, only.*

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from the wordpress plugin site, or using the 'Add Plugin' link
   on the plugin page of your Wordpress instance.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. (optional) Set a *Parent Page* for the created pages on the rootsPersona Options page.

At this point the plugin is ready to use.

Usage:
To import your first Gedcom and create your first page(s):

1. Find the pageId of the *Upload Gedcom File* page under rootsPersona Options and navigate to that page.
2. Browse for a Gedcom file on your local PC and select 'Upload'.
3. Select one or more persons to create pages for and select 'Submit'

Your Wordpress site will now have an information page for each person selected!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When I try to import a Gedcom file created by *my favorite program*, I get an error message: "Invalid GEDCOM file: invalid HEAD or TRLR" =

*rootsPersona* looks for a standard header ("0 HEAD") and trailer ("0 TRLR") record at the beginning and end of the gedcom file.
I found that some programs add control characters to the beginning of the file (Roots Magic for example).
Not sure why they are there, but if you simply delete these extra characters, save the file, and try again, it should work.

= What happened to the Gedcom file I uploaded? =

The Gedcom file on your PC is untouched.  The copy uploaded to Wordpress is converted into a set of
person and family files in XML format.  After conversion, the Gedcom file uploaded to Wordpress is deleted.
