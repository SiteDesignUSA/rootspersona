== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from the WordPress plugin site, or using the 'Add Plugin' link
   on the plugin page of your WordPress instance.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

At this point the plugin is ready to use!

== Upgrading from versions earlier than 2.0.0 ==

1. DO NOT DEACTIVATE THE OLDER VERSION.  (Unfortunately the old deactivate performs an uninstall,
   which will cause the loss of old data and probably timeout trying to delete pages.)
2. Upgrade the plugin as you normally would.  Make sure it is activated.
3. If you upgarde with a zip file, the first time you enter an Admin page the plugin upgrade process will kick off.
   This may cause a delay in rendering your admin page, but should be short.
3. Execute the conversion routine:  Tools->rootsPersona->Convert to 2.x format
   This will convert the old files to the new database, and may take a while to run.
4. Execute the validation routine: Tools->rootsPersona->Validate persona pages

Usage:

For detailed documentation, goto [ed4becky.net/plugins/rootsPersona] (http://ed4becky.net/plugins/rootsPersona "Documentation")

To import your first GEDCOM and create your first page(s):

1. Find the *Upload GEDCOM File* page link under rootsPersona Options.
2. Browse for a GEDCOM file on your local PC and select 'Upload'.
3. Select one or more persons to create pages for and select 'Submit'

Your WordPress site will now have one or more *persona* pages for the people you selected!

*Note: importing GEDCOM files from different programs can have unexpected consequences.
rootsPersona uses the ids generated in the GEDCOM file, and different programs may assign the same ids to different people.
It is recommended to manage your data in a single program (the 'system of record'),
and to use GEDCOM files generated by that program, only.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happened to the GEDCOM file I uploaded? =

The GEDCOM file on your PC is untouched.  The copy uploaded to WordPress is converted into a set of
person and family files in XML format.  After conversion, the GEDCOM file uploaded to WordPress is deleted.

= Why do I need a Parent Page? =

You do not.

However, if you are like me, you will soon end up with hundreds of persons on your site. Many widgets will display a link to all or some of your pages, and by creating the person pages under a parent, you can choose to exclude those hundreds of pages from your list. That is what I use it for; it is really just a convenience. By default the parent page is set to zero, which means no parent page.

= I only want people who are logged in to see certain people on my site. =

You can change the default privacy setting on the Options page, or override the setting on a page by page basis.

= When I try to upload a file, the screen goes blank. =

This is usually a timeout issue on your site.  See the explanation on the upload page.
